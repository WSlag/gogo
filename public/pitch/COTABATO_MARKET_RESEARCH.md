## 12. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR INVESTORS

### The Opportunity
Cotabato City is a **383,000-population city with ZERO ride-hailing apps** and only limited food delivery (Foodpanda). As the regional capital of BARMM with ₱114B budget and a brand new ₱10B mall, the city is primed for digital disruption.

2. BARMM economy growing 2.7% despite natural disasters
3. 92% e-wallet penetration among young Filipinos
4. No competition from Grab, Angkas, or other ride-hailing apps
5. Foodpanda has limited coverage - leaves room for super-app

### Why GOGO?
1. **Complete super-app**: Rides + Food + Grocery + Pharmacy
2. **Local-first approach**: Built for Cotabato, not adapted from Manila
3. **Working MVP**: Not just an idea - fully functional app
4. **Integrated payments**: GCash, Maya, wallet already built
5. **Scalable**: Same model can expand to GenSan, Kidapawan, etc.

### The Ask
